# Task 4.1 — Dotfiles Showcase

## Purpose
- Share a small, reproducible set of configuration files that capture how you like to work.
- The goal is portability and clarity: reviewers should be able to understand your choices and reproduce your environment with minimal effort.

## What this file contains
- A suggested minimal structure (no sample configs or runnable code).
- Notes about a safe, idempotent bootstrap approach (described conceptually).
- Deliverables and a short reviewer checklist.

## What to include
- A short `README.md` that explains:
  - Which shell and editor you primarily use.
  - One paragraph on the most important customizations and why you made them (prompt, aliases, editor keybindings).
  - Any platform-specific notes (macOS vs Linux vs WSL).
- A `dotfiles/` directory (optional: you may host dotfiles in a separate public repo and link to it):
  - Organize by tool: e.g., `zsh/`, `nvim/`, `git/`, `vscode/`, `bin/`.
  - Keep each config minimal — prefer a few focused settings rather than large monolithic files.
- A `bootstrap` plan (described below) — explain how a reviewer could apply your dotfiles safely.
- Screenshots (optional): one terminal screenshot and one editor screenshot to illustrate the final look.
- A link to your primary public dotfiles repo (if you host it elsewhere).

## Suggested minimal repository layout
- `task/<your-github-username>/4.1-dotfiles-showcase/`
  - `README.md` — this descriptive doc (one page)
  - `dotfiles/` — optional, small subset of configs (if you include them)
  - `bootstrap-plan.md` — safe instructions for applying configs (no automated destructive scripts)
  - `screenshots/` — optional images (terminal.png, editor.png)
  - `links.txt` — link to an external dotfiles repo (if any)

## Bootstrap approach
- Document an idempotent, non-destructive workflow:
  - Explain that existing config files will be backed up before any replacement (describe backup locations conceptually).
  - Prefer symlinks (or `stow`) as the method for deploying files, and explain why you chose that approach.
  - If you provide an automated script in your dotfiles repo, state explicitly what it will do (create backups, symlink files, install optional deps) and require a human to review before running.
- Do not include scripts that automatically overwrite system files without explicit confirmation.

## What *not* to commit
- Private keys, passwords, API tokens, or any secrets.
- Large binary files, editor caches, or package artifacts.
- Machine-specific absolute paths that break portability.

## Submission deliverables (for this task)
- Place your files under:
  - `task/<your-github-username>/4.1-dotfiles-showcase/`
- Include:
  - `README.md` — short summary, how to verify, and link to external dotfiles repo (if applicable).
  - `bootstrap-plan.md` — step-by-step plan describing how a reviewer could apply your configs safely (no automation required).
  - `screenshots/` — optionally include 1–2 images showing terminal/editor state.
  - `links.txt` — URL to your public dotfiles repo (if hosted separately).

## Reviewer verification checklist (what reviewers will check)
- README explains the major choices and how to verify.
- Bootstrap plan describes safe backup and restore behavior.
- Screenshots (if provided) are legible and demonstrate the claimed customizations.
- No secrets or large files present.
- If the dotfiles live in a separate repo, the `links.txt` contains a working URL.

## Short note on organizing content
- Keep each config focused: one file per tool where possible.
- Prefer small, well-documented snippets rather than huge, monolithic files.
- Add short comments in config files explaining non-obvious choices (but do not add long tutorials).

## Privacy & security reminder
- Sanitize screenshots and example outputs before committing.
- If your bootstrap instructions require elevated privileges, document that clearly and require explicit human confirmation.

## Resources
- README templates from popular dotfiles repos (search GitHub for “dotfiles” to see example layouts).
- `stow` or similar tools for symlink-based deployment (read the tool docs for usage).
- Dotfile management writeups and blog posts that explain backup-first workflows and idempotent installs.
