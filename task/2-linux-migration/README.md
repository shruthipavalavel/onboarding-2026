# Task — Linux Migration 

## Goal

Developers work best when they understand and control their environment.  
In this task, you will set up a Linux system and learn how to operate inside it confidently.

You are expected to make your own installation decisions, follow official documentation, and understand what you configure — not just run commands blindly.


# What This Task Builds

- Awareness of how operating systems support development  
- Confidence working in Linux environments  
- Comfort using the terminal for system tasks  


# Core Areas

You will practice:

- Selecting an appropriate Linux setup method  
- Configuring a usable development environment  
- Verifying your installation using terminal tools  


# Difficulty Levels

## Easy Level

Complete the basics:

- Install Linux using **Dual Boot or WSL**
- Confirm the system works using simple terminal commands  
  (navigation, package updates, system info tools, etc.)


## Advanced Level

Go further:

- Use Linux as your **main development environment**
- Explore:
  - File permissions  
  - Running processes  
  - Package management  
  - User configuration  


# Pre-requisites

- A personal laptop or PC  
- Basic familiarity with using a computer  
- Willingness to read official documentation  


# Safety First 

Before making OS changes:

- Back up important data  
- Understand what disk partitioning means if attempting dual boot  
- If unsure, start with WSL — it’s safer and reversible  

No task here is worth losing your files.


# Choosing a Setup Method

Pick what suits your comfort level:

### Dual Boot
- Best performance  
- Lets you switch between Windows and Linux  
- Requires disk space management  

### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Runs Linux inside Windows  
- Minimal risk  
- Great for development work  


# Suggested Workflow

1. Choose a Linux distribution (Ubuntu and Fedora are beginner-friendly)
2. Follow the **official installation guide** for your method
3. After installation:
   - Update packages  
   - Install basic tools (git, editor, etc.)  
   - Set up your user environment  
4. Verify everything works using terminal commands


# Verification Step

Run a system-info tool such as:
fastfetch


This confirms your Linux environment is running correctly.


# Expected Submission

Inside your submission folder include:

### 1️⃣ Screenshot
A clear image showing `neofetch` running in your Linux terminal.

### 2️⃣ GitHub Link
Your repository or PR containing your submission.


# Evaluation Criteria

Reviewers will check:

- Linux installed successfully  
- Environment configured correctly  
- Screenshot is valid and clear  
- Submission link works  


# What Success Looks Like

By finishing this task, you should:

- Comfortably open and use a Linux terminal  
- Understand how your OS affects development  
- Know how to install and manage software in Linux  


# Final Reminder

Don’t rush the install.  
Read guides carefully.  
Understand each step.

The goal is learning, not just finishing.
