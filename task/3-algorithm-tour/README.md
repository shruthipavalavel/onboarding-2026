# Task — Algorithm Tour

## Purpose
**Goal:** Explore how the same algorithms are expressed across different programming languages. This task highlights how logic, constraints, and reasoning vary between execution environments.


## Description of the Challenge
Participants implement the same algorithms in multiple languages to compare how identical logic is written and behaves across ecosystems.


## Sub-problems
- Implementing Binary Search  
- Implementing Merge Sort  
- Comparing language-level differences  


## Easy Level
Implement **one** of the following in a single language:
- Binary Search  
- Merge Sort  


## Advanced Level
Implement **both algorithms** in:
- C/C++  
- Python  
- JavaScript  

Document observed differences in:
- Control flow and expressiveness  
- Memory usage patterns  
- Error handling and safety guarantees  
- Debugging experience (breakpoints/logging recommended)  


## Pre-requisites
- Basic programming knowledge  


## Learning Outcomes
- Algorithmic thinking  
- Cross-language reasoning  
- Understanding implementation trade-offs  


## Expected Submission
- GitHub Gist containing all implementations  
- Short documentation describing choices and observations  


## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness of implementations  
- Clarity of explanation  
- Quality of comparison and reasoning
