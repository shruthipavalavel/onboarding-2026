# Good First Issues — Bonus Task

## Description of the Challenge

This bonus task introduces you to real-world open-source contribution. The goal is to get comfortable navigating external repositories, understanding how projects are maintained, and participating in collaborative development.

You will explore active projects, study how contributors communicate, and make a meaningful contribution through an issue or pull request.


## Objectives

- Understand how open-source projects are structured and maintained  
- Learn contribution etiquette and collaboration norms  
- Gain experience interacting with external codebases  


## Easy Level

Explore open-source repositories and observe:

- Project scope and recent activity  
- Contribution and code-of-conduct guidelines  
- Issue labels, triage style, and maintainer responses  

Document what you notice and how different projects manage contributions.


## Pre-requisites

- A GitHub account  
- Basic familiarity with Git (clone, branch, commit, PR)  


## Learning Outcomes

- Experience in open-source collaboration  
- Clear and professional technical communication  
- Confidence in selecting and solving small real-world issues  


## Expected Submission

Create a small submission folder containing:

- A link to a **merged** or **actively reviewed** Pull Request  
- A short write-up (1–2 paragraphs) describing:
  - The issue you chose  
  - What you changed or fixed  
  - Any feedback received from maintainers  


## Evaluation Criteria

Submissions are reviewed based on:

- Relevance and impact of the contribution  
- Correctness and quality of integration  
- Clarity and professionalism in communication  


## Tips for Success

- Start with repositories that label issues as *good first issue* or *beginner-friendly*  
- Read contribution guidelines carefully before submitting a PR  
- Keep changes small, focused, and well-explained  
- Be respectful and patient in discussions  


## Reminder

Open-source is about collaboration and learning. Even a small documentation fix or bug report counts if it adds value.
